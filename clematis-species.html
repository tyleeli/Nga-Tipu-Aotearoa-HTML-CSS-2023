      <h2 class="single-item__h2">Clematis species</h2>

      <h3 class="single-item__h3"><em>Clematis paniculata</em> (in M&amacr;ori puaw&amacr;nanga or puapua) is a species
        of flowering plant in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. It is one of seven species of clematis native to New
        Zealand. <em>C. paniculata</em> is the most common of these, and is widespread in forests throughout the
        country.</h3>

      <p class="single-item__introduction"><em>Clematis paniculata</em> is an evergreen woody high-climbing vine. It has
        a woody stem that is usually around 10 cm or more in diameter at the base. The leaves are dark and globous,
        sparsely hairy beneath. They have stout branchlets.</p>

          <li><em>Clematis paniculata</em> is native to New Zealand.</li>
          <li><em>C. paniculata</em> is found throughout New Zealand in lowland and subalpine forests.</li>
          <li>It flowers from August to November and has fruit throughout October to January.</li>
          <li>The seeds are easily dispersed by wind and they are contained in a silky feather-like cluster.</li>

        <p class="single-item__p"><em>Clematis paniculata</em> or known in Te Reo as Puawananga has great cultural
          significance in Te Ao M&amacr;ori.</p>
        <ul class="single-item__ul">
          <li>Many iwi believe that Puawananga, along with the Whauwhapaku, are the offspring of Puanga (Rigel) which is
            the brightest star of the Orion constellation and Ruhua (Antares) the most shining star of the Scorpion
            constellation the rising of these two stars in the morning signals the approach of summer and the time
            between the two events from June to November happens at the same time as when the Puawananga flowers bloom.
          </li>
          <li>M&amacr;ori also use the flowering of the plant as an indicator as that the season of spring has started
            and that the eels have started to migrate up the rivers to spawn therefore it was time to harvest them as
            this is a spring event, so the two events of the flowering and eel migrating coincided.</li>

        The Plant Names Database lists over 46,000 names and is a primary source of information for Ng&amacr; Tipu o
        Aotearoa - New Zealand Plants. The purpose of the New Zealand Plant Names Database is to provide an
        authoritative record of the scientific names, taxonomic concepts (i.e., synonymies), and biostatus for the
        lichens, liverworts, mosses, ferns, freshwater algae and seed plants in New Zealand. It also records the
        associated literature, vernacular and M&amacr;ori names, as well as recently published keys and descriptions for
        some taxa. <br>
